Hello, %s! Welcome to my RPG Game, where you will embark on an exciting journey through a series of challenges to defeat the final boss and claim victory. I assure you, it will be a hard path to take, but feel free to get used to everything! Right now you are standing in the Starting Town, where you can buy things, take refuge in and start your journey. Once you have done everything you want to do in Starting Town, then you can make your way to the next town, %s. See there, in the %s? That's the road you want to take.
Take a look at your Player Stats. You can level up your experience by fighting against monsters. The more experience you have, the stronger you are, but armour can drastically change that. Currency is measured in %ss. You don't have much money, do you? Here, I'll give you some to start you off. Take it, it's just a Gift!
Now, before I leave, I'll show you how to get around. You will get a dialogue that is shown as Menu> , where you can type what you want to do. Type 'stats' to show your Player Stats, and if you want to show only one of your Stats, type one of 'health', 'experience', 'attack', 'defense', or 'money' after 'stats' to show that exact Stat. Monsters will only spawn on roads while you go to other towns, unless the town you are at is not a safe zone. If so, when you get to the town, you will get a warning. Day and night are measured in realtime, and one day is 20 minutes. At night, there will be more monsters, each of which will be stronger, so make sure you get to an inn and sleep. Beware, this will cost 20 %ss, so make sure you have the money. Otherwise, come back in a few minutes and you'll be fine! Also, the Gift that I gave you can be claimed by typing 'gifts claim 1'. If you want any more help, type 'help'. Good luck!
